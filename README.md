# FF7 Bootleg's Mod Listing

The main page should point to the organization, and there should be a "ModListing" subfolder that holds html files for all the mods and similar.
You can kill my changes so far, it really doesn't matter. I don't know HTML yet, and probably not gonna learn in a few, so if you have access just do what's needed to make it look good.
You can join me on [#Bootleg_Dev on EsperNet](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=Bootleg_Dev&nick=) if you have any question or just to talk.
The Bootleg repo is [over here](https://github.com/vgr255/bootleg) although it might move to the organization before release, either if enough people work on it, or similar.

Either way, this is still a work-in-progress, and as long as it's not released there's no real need to get concerned over details. -Vgr
