# FF7 Bootleg's Mod Listing

This is the website ([available here](http://FF7Bootleg.github.io)) for Bootleg's mod listing and similar.
I cannot easily update the website as long as I work on the code itself, so other people will have to do it.
Feel free to contact me to ask for push access, I can give it to you without any problem.
Anything is fine except rewriting history and force-pushing to master. Also please have descriptive commit messages.
